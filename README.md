## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Based on the results of the linear regression analysis using all six variables, the spoiler_angle,  AWD and vehicle weight impact the MPG. Vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically unlikely to affect the MPG.

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. If the slope of the line was zero, the line would run flat along the horizontal axis.

The multiple R-squared value is 0.7149 which means approximately 71.5% of the variability of MPG is explained using the linear model. The p-value is 5.35e-11 which is smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%.

## Summary Statistics On Suspension Coils
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Based on the analysis, the results from the total_summary indicate the variance of 62.29356 is below the specified variance.

Based on the analysis, the results from the lot_summary indicate the variance for lots 1 and 2 fall below the specified variance. The lot 3 variance results exceed the design specification variance of 100 pounds per square inch.
